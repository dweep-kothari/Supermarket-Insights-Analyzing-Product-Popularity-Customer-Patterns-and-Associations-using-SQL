# Supermarket Data Analysis using SQL

This project aims to analyze product popularity, customer shopping patterns, and associations within a supermarket dataset using SQL queries. The goal is to extract valuable insights to optimize inventory management, improve customer experience, and make data-driven decisions.

## Database Setup

- Create a MySQL database named "supermarket" to store the supermarket data.

- Execute the provided Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to create the required tables: aisles, departments, product, orders, and order_product. Ensure appropriate primary keys and foreign key relationships are established.

## Importing the Data

- Utilize the provided Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to import the dataset into the respective tables in the supermarket database. Adjust the file paths in the statements to match the location of the dataset files on your system.

## Business Scenarios and SQL Queries

The project covers several business scenarios and the corresponding SQL queries to gain insights from the supermarket data. Execute the following queries to obtain the desired reports:

1. Top 10 Products Based on Day of the Week:
   - Identify the most popular products sold on each day of the week.
   - Query: See the SQL query provided under the "Top 10 Products Sales For Each Day of the Week" comment.

2. Location Analysis: Top Products by Aisle and Department:
   - Determine the top-selling products in each aisle and department.
   - Query: See the SQL query provided under the "5 most popular products in each aisle from Monday to Friday" comment.

3. Regular Shopping Path of Customers:
   - Analyze the typical shopping path of customers by identifying the sequence of their product purchases.
   - Query: See the SQL query provided under the "Most popular shopping paths" comment.

4. Association in Customers' Orders:
   - Identify associations or commonly co-occurring products in customers' orders.
   - Query: See the SQL query provided under the "Top pairwise associations in products" comment.

Feel free to execute and modify the provided SQL queries as per your requirements, and explore the dataset to derive additional insights.

## Conclusion

By leveraging SQL queries on the supermarket dataset, this project enables valuable analysis of product popularity, customer shopping patterns, and associations. The obtained insights can help optimize inventory management, improve customer experience, and guide decision-making processes.
